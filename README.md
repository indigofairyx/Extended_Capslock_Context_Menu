	+ insert the date and time,
	+ shift your number row when capslock is ON, e.g.
		`1234567890-=[]\
		~!@#$%^&*()_+{}|


From the 'Open\Run\Explore...     [ Files Menu ]' , you can ...
... When a Folder\File Path, Url, or Regkey path is [*SELECTED*]
e.g. C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\AutoHotkey\Some Script File.ahk

	- Open a folder
	- Run\Open the file without navigating to it.
	*- Copy the file\folder to your clipboard
		*Requires Directory Opus.

	- copy the Content of a text-base file to you clipboard without opening it
	- copy directory details via the CMD prompt
	- make a Duplicate File Copy, adding a ' -CopyDup.ext' suffix
	- move a file, into it own sub-folder, or up into its parent folder

		* its limited to Notepad++ and Everything
		* in Notepad++, if nothing is selected,
		  it will show the Dir of the active file.

++ Other Features With Toggle Options ++

	+ light & dark mode toggle (DARK is default),

++++ ADDITONAL MENUS ++++

	+ A custom built Open With\In Alternative Text Editor Menu that works in NP++ (on the active file viewing) and in Everything 1.5a (when a file is selected).
	+ The Hotkey for this Menu is {F9}
	+ There's a handful of light-weight text editors that I play with... This menu can be made to work in other applications...
